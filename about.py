    ## Welcome to the Multi-Page RAG Model App!

    This app allows you to interact with different types of data using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. Below are the main features and a user guide to help you navigate through the app.

    ### Features
    - **PDF/Docx Model**: Upload your PDF or Docx files and ask questions about the data.
    - **Web Model**: Provide a URL and ask questions based on the web page content.
    - **CSV Model**: Upload a CSV file and ask questions about the data.
    - **Session Management**: The app maintains the conversation history for each model, so you can switch between models without losing context. This history is maintained until you reset it.

    ### User Guide
